# Space Invading Unicorns

## Project Description
This project is made for the local Space Apps Challenge 2024 hackathon in Gothenburg, Sweden. Our chosen challenge is called **Community Mapping**, where we decided to visualise data from NASA for the user to find out their most suitable place of living. The data we use includes air pollution, temperature, vegetation and population density levels all over the world. The user can set their preferences in these categories and choose the priority for each theme. Based on the user's choices and the data provided by NASA the app will find the most suitable place for this user and display it for them.
